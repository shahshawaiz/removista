# Removista

Removista is a sucessful implementation of my our own designed obstruction removal algorithm, answering a long-due question of computer vision. Using Digital Image Processing (DIP), with some assumptions and constraints, we have successfully found a solution for obstruction free photography which can be further improved. Our algorithm can remove occlusion without disturbing the actual composition of scene and protecting our object of interest. This application primarily uses industry-standard computer vision library OpenCV. 

Note: This application has been made available on Google Playstore. It can be downloaded [removista].
